# CardiacRecorder
Cardiac Recorder’ is a platform where we update the data of Blood pressure and heart rate. We can also update and delete those records.



OBJECTIVES:
• Solving a problem by constructing a simple, interactive application using Android and Java. 
• Documenting an object-oriented design in Unified Modeling Language (UML). 
• UI design mockup by designing the activity screens of your app in advance. 
• Creating Documentation using Javadoc and host it using github.io  
• Writing unit tests and intent tests to do rigorous checking of  code and UI. 
• Continuous integration using Travis CI with GitHub.
